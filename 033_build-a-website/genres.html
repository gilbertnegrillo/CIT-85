        <h1 id="rock">ROCK MUSIC GENRE</h1>
        <small><a href="#top">Back to top</a></small>
        <p>Rock ’n’ roll is a popular music genre that combines elements of rhythm and blues (R&B), jazz, and country music with the addition of electric instruments. Originally associated with youth revolt and transgression, the genre is known for energetic performances, catchy melodies, and often insightful lyrics.</p>
        <p>Local scenes: As rock music surged in popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, localized scenes began to spring up. Cities renowned for their rock music scenes include Memphis, New York, Los Angeles, London, Birmingham, and Dublin. Indie rock, which tends to be more localized, has thrived in cities like Athens, Georgia; Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and Tucson, Arizona. Some of these scenes revolved around a music studio (like Sam Phillips' Sun Studios in Memphis) or a record label (like Dischord Records in Washington, DC).</p>
        <p>Electric instruments and drum kits: Most rock bands are anchored around an electric guitar, electric bass, and drum kit. Some bands have keyboard players, and many rock guitarists double on acoustic guitar, but the core of the band tends to be electric (and often quite loud). Virtuoso rock musicians include guitarist Jimi Hendrix, drummer Neal Peart, bassist John Entwistle, and keyboardist Keith Emerson.</p>

        <h1 id="country">COUNTRY MUSIC GENRE</h1>
        <small><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></small>
        <p>Country music is an American musical style that incorporates elements of folk, bluegrass, blues, and rural dance music. Music historians trace its origins to the southern Appalachian Mountains in the late 1920s, particularly in eastern Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Over the course of the twentieth century, the genre spread in all directions, particularly westward, which has led some to refer to it as country western music.</p>
        <p>Country is a Top 40 genre. In the twenty-first century, mainstream country music rivals hip hop and dance pop for dominance of the Billboard charts. Singer-songwriters like Taylor Swift, Miranda Lambert, Blake Shelton, Eric Church, Carrie Underwood and Lady Antebellum enjoy widespread airplay and inclusion on pop music streaming playlists. Televised industry events like the Country Music Awards (CMA) have brought further awareness to the genre and increased its reach.</p>
        <p>String bands were popular in the 1930s and ’40s. Country music had many virtuosic players on the guitar, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and bass. Performing as bluegrass string bands, artists like Earl Scruggs and Doc Watson created country hits based around dynamic playing. These players became stars of Appalachia, Texas, and rural America after performing in clubs known as honky tonks and on radio broadcasts.</p>

        <h1 id="hip-hop">HIP-HOP MUSIC GENRE</h1>
        <small><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></small>
        <p>Hip-hop is a genre of music most often characterized by a strong, rhythmic beat and a rapping vocal track. The genre originated in New York City in the 1970s as a cultural exchange among Black, Latino, and Caribbean youth and has grown into one of the most consumed genres of music in the United States. As a culture, hip-hop is built on four main pillars: DJing, rapping (also called MCing), breakdancing (usually called breaking or b-boying), and graffiti.</p>
        <p>The golden era: The late 1980s and early 1990s were the golden age of hip-hop, in which many performers enjoyed huge mainstream success while introducing major innovations with each new record. Major artists included Public Enemy, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., MC Hammer, Boogie Down Productions, Snoop Dogg, Nas, A Tribe Called Quest, and Big Daddy Kane. The era also saw the rise of gangsta rap, a subgenre that emphasized the lifestyle of inner-city youth and was characterized by artists like Schoolly D, Ice-T, and N.W.A.</p>
        <p>Tupac Shakur: Tupac Shakur is widely regarded to be one of the most influential rappers. Part of the gangsta rap movement, Tupac is known for his inventive, often poetic lyrics. His 1996 album, All Eyez on Me, was certified diamond, and all five of his posthumous albums have been certified platinum.</p>

        <h1 id="pop">POP MUSIC GENRE</h1>
        <small><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></small>
        <p>Pop music is the genre of popular music that produces the most hits. A hit is a song that sells many copies, and the latest hits are listed every week on the charts. To get on the charts, a song must be released as a single, although most singles are also released on an album. Songs that become hits almost always share certain features that are sometimes called the pop-music formula.</p>
        <p>They have a good rhythm, a catchy melody, and are easy to remember and sing along to. They usually have a chorus that's repeated several times and two or more verses. Most pop songs are between two and five minutes long, and the lyrics are usually about the joys and problems of love and relationships.</p>
        <p>Artists like these produce hit singles by writing songs that follow the pop-music formula but include elements of their own genre, and by doing this they can create their own unique style of pop music. Look at the list of best-selling artists below and notice how many have experience in more than one genre. It's artists like these who are most likely to create new styles of pop music in the future.</p>
