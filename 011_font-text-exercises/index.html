    <div style="font-family: serif;">
        <h1>Serif</h1>
        <p>Serif has a little foot. A slight projection finishing off a stroke of a letter in certain typefaces. Serif fonts are easier to read in printed works.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="font-family: sans-serif;">
        <h1>Sans-Serif</h1>
        <p>Sans-serif is a straight line. Sans in French translates to without in English, meaning without the serif. Sans-serif fonts are better on the web.</p>

        <p>Lastly, listening is crucial in communication, especially if you’re receiving important information. My listening style varies on the situation that I am in. Everyone has at least encountered a person where they just drag on their story and you’re just there nodding your head and smiling pretending to be interested. When this happens, I mostly use pseudo listening as a way of letting the person know that my presence is still there, but I won’t be paying attention to what they’re saying. Even if I try to give them cues to stop talking, they just ignore it. On the contrary, I like to use critical listening style for when I want to interpret the meaning behind someone’s message. When my friends and I get in a heated conversation or debate, I usually try to mediate things by analyzing their skill and frequency behind their messages.</p>
        <p>Moreover, fundamental attribution error is another type of attribution error where people overate internal factors over external factors when explaining other’s negative behaviors. Consequently, this causes some people to view others negatively even though their behavior isn’t like that consistently. From my perspective, it’s easier to explain a person’s negative behavior on internal attributions because we can observe their personality. Nevertheless, it’s difficult to explain a person’s negative behavior on external attributions because there could be other factors causing them to behave negatively that I don’t know of. For example, I committed a fundamental attribution error when I perceived my friend to be rude the first time we meet because he would make fun of me, but I later found out that it was just his way of trying to make me laugh.</p>
        <p>The culture in the U.S. is different from the culture I had in the Philippines. In the Philippines, it’s seen as a collectivistic culture and our way of communicating to one another is by using formal honorifics. For example, we refer to someone who is older or someone with authority as “mam” and “sir.” Additionally, we also use the conjugations of, “po” and “opo” to show respect. Nevertheless, I was surprised when students in the U.S. addressed their teachers as Mr., Ms., or Mrs. because I always referred to them as “mam” or “sir.” The U.S. is an individualistic culture, and their way of communicating is very straightforward. For instance, I had trouble fitting in because of language barrier and I had difficulties interpreting what they were saying to me. I felt as if I was an outsider, but people still perceived me to be friendly. After a while, I was able to be in a group of friends that showed me how to communicate with their style. Overall, communication can be difficult but it’s tougher if you are unfamiliar with a culture.</p>
