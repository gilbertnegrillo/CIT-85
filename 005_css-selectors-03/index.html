<p>Our ability to perceive information is critical in communication. The process of perception in communication is broken down into three. First, when information is being given to us, our selection is put in play. Often, we don’t like to listen to something if it’s not in our best interest and that can cause us to miss important information. Second, once we have selected the information we want, we arrange it. It depends on whether we keep or remove that information in our memory. After the information has been organized, we try to explain the meaning behind it. Typically, we try to look at the bigger picture and later come up with our own interpretation.</p>

<p>Moreover, we have the tendency to attribute behaviors differently from others which can result in errors. More often, we praise ourselves rather than give credit and blame others for our failures. The way we perceive information depends on our listening style and how effective we listen. When we do a poor job of listening, then people will perceive us to be bad at receiving information. On the other hand, when we are actively listening to what the speaker is saying, then they will perceive us to be trustworthy with their information. Being an effective listener can help us improve our communication skills.</p>

<p>According to the attribution theory, our way of explaining our own behaviors is different from when we explain other’s behaviors. This can lead to attribution errors because our way of explaining other people’s behaviors isn’t always accurate. In addition, the perception that we create towards ourselves tend to be flawed as well because our biases can mislead us. The first type of attribution error is self-serving bias, which refers to favoring oneself to boost self-esteem. It’s common for people to take part in self-serving bias because we’re wired to preserve our self-esteem from getting hurt. At times, I do find myself using self-serving bias even if I don’t notice it. For instance, when I won a basketball game with my friends, I praised myself for being the best player on the team, but when we lost, I blamed my teammates for playing badly. Moreover, fundamental attribution error is another type of attribution error where people overate internal factors over external factors when explaining other’s negative behaviors.</p>
