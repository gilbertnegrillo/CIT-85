            <p>I was born in the Philippines but moved to the U.S. in 2010. It felt good to be back when my family and I went back in 2013 to visit our relatives. We went their during summer break and stayed for about a month.</p>

            <p>During our 2013 vacation we went to Hundred Islands which is located in Alaminos, Pangasinan, Philippines. We got to visit around 2 or 3 islands out of the hundred islands located their. We got to station in one of the beaches where we stayed their for the whole day. We went with our cousins and extended family.</p>

            <p>When I was younger, my mom took me and my sister to Baguio which is located in northern Luzon. It is above sea level and has a lot of mountains which is why it is considered to be cold than other areas in the Philippines. I had the chance to do horse back riding and got to tour around.</p>
