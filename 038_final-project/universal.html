            <p>Going to Universal Studios Hollywood around 2014 with my cousins and family was one of the best moments that I had. We went during summer break and I still want to go visit it again someday. I want to go during Halloween Horror Nights and have a go with their haunted house.</p>

            <p>If I recall call correctly, the first ride that I went on was the Transformer 3D ride. Followed by Revenge of the Mummy, Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, and the old Jurasic Park ride. The most memorable ride was the studio tour guide because it was interactive and we were able to see a little behind the scenes of how movies are made.</p>

            <p>If you have never been to Universal Stduios before, I would recommend the WaterWorld attraction first. It is an action packed show that you don't want to miss out on. The show is about 20 minutes long consiting of stunts, water, flame, and an explosive crash.</p>
