            <p>In 2014, I went to San Francisco with my family and cousins. Personally, this is one of the best places to travel because it isn't too crowded. We also got to tour around different parts of San Francisco even though it was windy that day.</p>

            <p>Seeing the Golden Gate Brdige that day was unreal because I only saw images of it online. We didn't walk the bridge the whole way but to be standing their in person made me realize how tall and long it is. No wonder it is in the top 25 landmarks worldwide.</p>

            <p>I can't remember what trial we used but I do remember going on a hike right after visiting the Golden Gate Bridge. As someone who doesn't go to the outdoors as much, I would say the hike was fairly easy. The location of the hike allowed us to see the whole of the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
