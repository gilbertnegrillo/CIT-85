            <p>The first attraction that me and family went to was Tunnel View because it was the closest of where we entered. Tunnel view is the place for you if you don't like to do any hiking. We went during spring time and got to see El Capitan, Half Dome, and Bridalveil point from the tunnel view.</p>

            <p>We were able to see the famous Yosemite Falls using the lower trails where you didn't have to do too much hike and you can also see the lake of the waterfall. You could see the waterfall up and personal if you use the lower trail. The best time to go is during spring because during our visit it had good flow.</p>

            <p>If you intend to camp at Yosemite you can go to Lower Pines. In our visit, we used lower pines to eat because it also had tables. From my experience, lower pines has geat sceneary with a lot of pine trees and minimal noise. There wasn't a lot of people and is a great spot to relax because the pine trees provide shade.</p>
