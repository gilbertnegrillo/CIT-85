    <h1>Basketball Players</h1>

    <p>There has been a lot of debate on who the G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time) is in basketball. Some say Michael Jordan, other people say Kobe Bryant, 
    and a couple of people mention Lebron James. Usually, people have Lebron, Kobe, and MJ on their top three but they can be ranked differently depending on the person. 
    My list can seem unusual to most basketball fans because it has Stephen Curry but I included him because of the impact he has in the game. 
    In addition, he changed the way the game has played today. In fact, people would rather take a three rather than go for an easy layup.
    Consequently, the amount of threes being attempted in the NBA has increased unlike in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s, where there wasn't a lot of threes being attempted. </p>
